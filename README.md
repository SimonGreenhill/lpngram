Python library for ngram collection and frequency smoothing.

`lpngram` is a pure-Python implementation of methods for ngram collection and frequency
smoothing, originally part of the [`lingpy`](http://lingpy.org/) library. It has no
dependencies, but will use `numpy` and `scipy`, if available, to speed smoothing
computations. It was designed to work on any kind of sequence, not just words, and
has been successfully used to collect phoneme n-grams.

## Changelog

Version 0.1:
  - First public release.

## Installation

In any standard Python environment, `lpngram` can be installed with:

```bash
pip install lpngram
```

The `pip` installation will also fetch the dependencies `numpy` and `scipy`. If those
are not desired, the library can be used by just copying the files in the
`lpngram` directory.
